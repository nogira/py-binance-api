# Binance API

Made by scraping [binance docs](https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs) to allow for easy updates as the API changes. 

Functions include some documentation, but if in need of more information, read the [binance docs](https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs) (The parameters listed in the docs are the same name as in the python wrapper).

Note: the `timestamp` parameter is autogenerated by the wrapper so while it is a mandatory parameter to call some things in binance's API, you do not need to declare it when using this wrapper.

### Basic Setup

```shell
pip install pybinanceapi
```

```py
import pybinanceapi as pb

# declare api key and secret
# (can also declare 'baseurl' (default is https://api.binance.com) or 'email')
pb.vars(
    api_key='FaROkRyeIfyMeAS53cmVlzVHCTcpcM7qPf2Mlf9nz3QpOEmYbOGOugndQ11pyX8D', 
    api_secret='ZnDfwtZZ7s2QXhw5pw65rzT6IKX731fIj78M7MGpdmiH5UdMhyujBlRxBqZldDFm'
)
```
