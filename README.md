# Binance API

Made by scraping [binance docs](https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs) to allow for easy updates as the API changes. Thus, for more info on this API, read binance docs (The parameters in the docs are the same name as in the python wrapper.).

Note: the `timestamp` parameter is autogenerated by the wrapper so while it is a mandatory parameter to call some things in binance's API, you do not need to declare it when using this wrapper.
